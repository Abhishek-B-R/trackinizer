"""Background loop that keeps the derived authority columns fresh.

Authority (PageRank) is a global fixed point, so it is recomputed wholesale
rather than per write. This loop coalesces bursts: it recomputes when at least
:data:`DIRTY_EDGES` edge mutations have landed since the last run OR
:data:`MAX_INTERVAL_SEC` has elapsed, and never more often than
:data:`MIN_INTERVAL_SEC`. An idle graph costs nothing; a busy one folds many
edge changes into one recompute.

Edge mutations are counted from ``change_log`` (every ``add_edge`` /
``remove_edge`` writes an audit row), so the write path gains no new coupling --
the loop polls the audit the store already keeps.
